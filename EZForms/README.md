# EZForms

*EZForms* is a basic set of support classes that integrates with [EZAppMaker](https://github.com/derlidio/EZAppMaker).

It works with SQLite and will take care of all your needs on the CRUD regard. You won't have
to write a single SQL statement. You won't have to create models for your tables. Yow wont't
have to bind to Entity Framework. Just plug your SQLite database and write a markup
file (XML) to tell EZForms what you want to see, how you want to see it, and that's it.

EZForms is still under development. It's current version can handle single-record forms pretty
well. Future releases may bring: master-detail forms, multi-column-forms, and linked-forms.
